<h2>How would you create a social network that improves your career?</h2>

<h4>The Challenge</h4>
<p>Intronet wanted to make it easier for people to share connections, information, and expertise without the baggage of existing platforms.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>I research what other networks were doing and users' satification with them. Armed with this data, I looked for unexplored niches to differentate our product.</p>
<p>Intronet had previous success with a web-based introduction product. Using that learning, along with new research, we set out create a place where people could get help form trusted members of their real-world networks. Additionally, users could be introduced to new contacts with confidence through their own trusted sources.</p>

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>In early user testing, people reacted positively to the app. They were willing to share their contacts and egnage with app's feartures. We had started to build a digital product that let use privately leverage their offline relationships.</p>
