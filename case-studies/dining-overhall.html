<h3>Challenge</h3>
<p>The client was looking to improve the overall customer experience and expand the usage of their platform. Every campus using their system, many locations and options people could choose from. In its current state, it was difficult to both find a specific location, as well as explore multiple options.</p>
<p>The new solution needed to work with their current backend management systems that control real-times delivery of perishable items, purchasing online and in person, integration other tracking systems.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>Because my team was working not just with out client, but also other vendors, time became the driving force in our management of the project. I worked directly with the business owners to understand their needs and ensure the new product would support their business goals. At the same time, I collected and analyzed the current customers’ journeys, using them to help find where we could improve the flow and offer improved services.</p>

<h4>Addressing pain points</h4>
<p>My first priority was to design a flexible system to serve the campus businesses, which also helped their customers find what they were looking for. After that, I dove into the purchase flows to make sure that customers could complete their purchases with the least friction possible.</p>

<h4>Tactical changes</h4>
<p>I focused on refining and simplifying the design, creating less complex forms, card-based information grouping, and a light weight, approachable personality.</p>
<p>I worked with the customer’s product owner to review and revise the copy. I rewrote copy for clarity and give it a more human voice. I consulted with them on how to go about evaluating future copy.</p>

<p>Serving as a consultant on this project, I’m not able to collect ongoing data. We have received positive reviews as our client rolls the new design to their customers, including:</p>
