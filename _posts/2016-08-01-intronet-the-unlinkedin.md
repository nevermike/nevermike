**Our Goal:** Build a service for people to share connections, information, and expertise with in their trusted networks of colleagues and friends.

**Our Challenge:** Design an application that emphasizes quality connections, based a personâ€™s contextual needs. Surfacing quality connections and actionable information to the application could help people make better real world decisions.

**My Roll:** UX/UI/Branding

This was a risky interaction, but it was also core to the intelligence of the product. The approach was to keep this information complete private and use it to inform introductions and show people the most content that was the most relevant to them.
