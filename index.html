      <h2>Design generalist and digital specifist</h2>
      <h3>What's all that mean?</h3>
      <p>Usually some combination of user experience, user interface, product planning, facilitating, and problem solving. I love working with people to find better ways to get things done. And these days, thereâ€™s usually a computer involved along the way.</p>
