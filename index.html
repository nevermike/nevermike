      <h1>I’m Michael, nevermike</h1>
      <h3>Design generalist and digital specifist</h3>
      <p>What's that mean? Usually some combination of UX, UI, product planning, facilitating, and problem solving. I love working with people to find better ways to get things done. And these days, there’s usually a computer involved along the way.</p>
