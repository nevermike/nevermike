    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p class="me-little">
      <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/me-little.png" alt="">
      Born and raised in central NJ, I was privileged roll through the salad days of late 80s &amp; early 90s East Coast punk rock and skate culture. Pulled north by the lure of the city so nice they named it twice, and emboldened by the lyrics of the Beasties bumping in my head, I enrolled at the School of Visual Arts and threw myself into the world of fine art. Not entirely sure what that meant, I knew I wanted to make something. At the time, my biggest influences were David Carsonâ€™s work at Raygun Magazine, Jasper Johns, and Hieronymus Bosch.</p>

      After graduation, I design and produced hand-painted wall paper made from heavy metals and highly toxic paint. Luckily, for my central nervous system, the internet was getting ready to help change my career path. An old childhood love of computers floated to the surface right alongside the dot com bubble. I even got to be a part of a very exciting public offering.</p>

    <p>I toiled for the next few years in the slums and tenements of what would later be dubbed "Silicon Alley". As the bubble burst, I moved on to the city of brotherly love, where I continued working with startups and agencies.</p>

    <p class="me-now">I love exploring problems and discovering solutions.</p>
