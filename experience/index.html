    <h3>I help companies deliver great experiences to their customers</h3>

    <p>After graduating from The School of Visual Arts, my career kicked-off during the early days of NYC’s Silicon Alley. I learned a lot about how to adapt design principals to the web, taught myself how to make websites, and used these skills to help business offer better experiences to the customers.</p>

    <h4>Design thinking and teaching</h4>
    <p>I began teaching as an adjunct professor at Drexel’s Westphal College of Media Arts & Design in the early ’00s. My classes focused on helping graphic design students translate their talents to digital products. Currently, I teach at the University of the Arts. Through the continuing education department, I help people develop their skills and explore careers in user experience design.</p>

    <p>I’m super proud that a number of my students are leading the current, and next waves of design in Philadelphia and around the country.</p>

    <p>For more information about classes I’m teaching visit the <a href="https://www.uarts.edu/ce/uxdesign">University of the Arts Continuing Education programs</a>.</p>

    <h4>So here’s the thing</h4>
    <p>When you work with me, you get both my business and teaching experience. This is good for you because I’ll help you think like a designer. I’ll lead workshops, make prototypes, and test them with real people.</p>

    <p>We’ll dig into your product and figure it what makes it great. You’ll end up understanding your business, your products, and your customers on a deeper level.</p>
