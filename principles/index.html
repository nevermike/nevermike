    <h3>I’m happy to help you do good work</h3>

    <h4>Good design shouldn’t hide its agenda</h4>
    <p>A product should be clear about what it’s doing for you and what it’s doing with your information. You should be able to make use of it and move on with your life. Using psychological ticks to steal your attention is dishonest. I’m not interested in lies.</p>

    <h4>Good design shouldn’t hurt</h4>
    <p>A product should help you. Whoever <strong>you</strong> are. If a side effect of a product ends up harming people, the design was not successful. It needs to be fixed and the harm remedied. Even more so, if its intention is make someone’s life worse, it should never be made. That goes for anything supporting guns, fascist ideology, racism, anti-LGBTQ, and patriarchal domination of society. I’m not here to help with any of that.</p>

    <h4>Good design shouldn’t be dull</h4>
    <p>A product should be engaging. Remember when the internet was weird and fun? I’d like to keep that spirit alive. I’m not really excited by trends and cookie cutter designs (though I do enjoy these <a href="https://www.hummingbirdhigh.com/2015/01/24-hour-24-dollar-chocolate-chip-cookies.html">cookies</a>). I want to present things in their clearest form with a little surprise when possible.</p>

    <h4>About me</h4>
    <p>I value progressive politics, feminism, and compassion. I practice the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUmgrve1sZc">gentle art</a> of Brazilian Ju-jitsu. I love to cook and share food with my family and friends. And, I’m probably listening at a podcast right now.</p>

    <p>My pronouns are he/him/his.</p>
